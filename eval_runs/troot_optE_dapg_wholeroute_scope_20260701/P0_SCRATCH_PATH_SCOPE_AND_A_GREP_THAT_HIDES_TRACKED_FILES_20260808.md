# P0 — the scratch-path hazard: what is really at risk, how many sites, and an instrument that hides tracked files

date: 2026-08-08 22:09–22:19 JST (measured)
author: w2:p0
target: p18 m-p18-97's priority argument on micro-chunk (b) — *"THE DRIVER THAT PRODUCES THE DoD
VIDEO WRITES INTO A DEAD SESSION'S SCRATCH DIRECTORY"*, cited at `ur15_steps_wired.py:32`.
read at: commit **`cbb35bc78f`** (p18 cited `8d2ffc154b`; that is an ancestor of what I read —
`git merge-base --is-ancestor` = YES). The 13 driver files are **clean** (`git status --porcelain`
over `p4_ur15_sim_20260727/*.py` = empty), so every file citation below is as-committed.

⚠ **Evidence grade, per m-p18-100 §1, applied to my own numbers before sending them.** My first
pass took its counts over the shared working tree. I re-took every count from the commit with
`git grep <rev>`; all of them reproduce, and the denominators are the commit's. Nothing below
rests on the uncommitted tree.

## 0. Verdict

| item | verdict |
|---|---|
| p18's citation of `:32` | ✅ **exact** — that literal is on that line |
| **the site count** | ⛔ **14 lines in 13 files, not 1.** A chunk scoped to `:32` fixes 1 of 14 |
| **"the DoD video writes into it"** | ⛔ **measured false.** All 9 mp4 outputs go to `~/Downloads`, each with `mkdir(parents=True)` |
| **but the escalation is right, for a stronger reason** | ⭐ `S` is the **model-build path**, written then **read straight back**, and **never created** |
| **the hazard has already fired once** | ⭐ the URDF's generating xacro lived there and is **gone** |
| the dir's state | ✅ exists 22:09:12 JST; 4 files, all mtime **Aug 4 15:26** |
| ⭐ **the instrument everyone uses for absence** | ⛔ **repo-root `grep -r` silently drops a TRACKED file.** Measured: 24 vs 25 vs 26 across three instruments |

## 1. ⛔ The count is 14, not 1 — and one session id, closed over all of them

Two independent instruments, then a third from the commit:

| instrument | files | lines |
|---|---|---|
| `grep -n 'b952db35' *.py` | 13 | 14 |
| `find -maxdepth 1 -name '*.py' -exec grep` (explicit args, no recursion) | 13 | 14 |
| **`git grep -l … cbb35bc78f -- '*.py'`** (the commit, not the tree) | **13** | **14** |

denominator: **40** `.py` files in the directory at that commit.

| file:line | binding |
|---|---|
| `ur15_steps_wired.py:32` | `S` ← p18's citation |
| `ur15_steps.py:50`, `ur15_steps_reaim.py:50`, `ur15_steps_c1seat.py:50` | `S` |
| `ur15_route.py:46`, `ur15_cell.py:44` | `S` |
| `ur15_yoke_video.py:25`, `ur15_grip_video.py:24`, `ur15_final_video.py:21` | `S` |
| `probe_handedness.py:16` | `S` |
| `probe_crown_band_occupancy.py:41` | `SRC` |
| `probe_home_pose_symmetry.py:41` | `AS_BUILT` |
| `render_cell_overview.py:36` **and** `:38` | `AS_BUILT`, `SRC` — the only file with two |

⭐ Closed over the *space*, not just the one id: `grep -oh 'claude-1000/-home-rlrk-IsaacLab/[0-9a-f-]*' *.py | sort | uniq -c` returns exactly **one** entry, `14 …b952db35…`. There is no second dead session hiding in the drivers.

⚠ Three of the fourteen are bound to names other than `S` (`SRC`, `AS_BUILT`). A fix that greps for `^S = Path(` would miss them — the same "verify at the delivery surface, not the source variable name" shape.

## 2. ⛔ The video is the one output that is *not* at risk

I checked every driver before contradicting the claim, not just the one cited:

| driver | mp4 target | parent created? |
|---|---|---|
| `ur15_steps_wired.py:34` / `:3806-3807` | `argv[1]` else `/home/rlrk/Downloads/ur15_steps.mp4` | ✅ `:3806` |
| `ur15_steps_wired.py:2783` `LIVE_OUT` | `~/Downloads/ur15_live.mp4` | ✅ `:2784` |
| `ur15_steps.py:52` / `ur15_steps_reaim.py:52` / `ur15_steps_c1seat.py:52` | `~/Downloads/ur15_steps.mp4` | ✅ each |
| `ur15_route.py:49`, `ur15_final_video.py:22`, `ur15_grip_video.py:26`, `ur15_yoke_video.py:27` | `~/Downloads/ur15_{route,pd,grip,yoke}.mp4` | ✅ each |

⇒ **no driver writes a video into the scratchpad.** Every one of the nine takes `argv[1]` or a
`~/Downloads` default, and every one calls `OUT.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.

The single rendered image that does land there is `ur15_cell.py:201`
`imageio.imwrite(str(S / "cell_settled.png"), …)` — a settled-cell still, not the DoD video.

⚠ I am correcting the object of the sentence, not the priority. The priority argument survives §3 and §4 in a stronger form.

## 3. ⭐ What actually depends on `S`: the model build, read back, and never created

| line | what |
|---|---|
| `:131` | `p = S / f"_arm_only_{tag}.xml"` — the IK-seed arm-only models |
| `:287` | `(S / "_steps_world.xml").write_text(world)` |
| **`:288`** | **`cell = mujoco.MjSpec.from_file(str(S / "_steps_world.xml"))`** — written, then **read straight back** |
| `:328` | `(S / "_steps_cell_full.xml").write_text(cell.to_xml())` |
| `:3808-3810` | `# hand p11 the path, not a summary of it` → `_tr = S / "sigma_trace.txt"` → `open(_tr, "w")` |

and **`S` is never created**. The file contains exactly **2** `mkdir` calls — `:2784` and `:3806` —
both for the `~/Downloads` video parents.

⇒ two consequences, and neither is the one that was stated:

- **the run cannot build its scene.** `Path.write_text` and `open(…, "w")` do not create parents,
  so a reclaimed directory raises at `:287`, **before the model exists**. The failure is at setup
  and loud, not a silent loss of evidence. ⚠ This is a reading of the code plus documented Python
  behaviour — I did not execute it.
- ⭐ **the one artifact produced for another desk by path is the one at risk.** `:3808` says
  *"hand p11 the path, not a summary of it"* — the summary is deliberately withheld, and the path
  points into the reclaimable directory. If it is reclaimed between the run and p11's read, p11
  gets a dead path and there is no summary to fall back on.

## 4. ⭐ The hazard is not hypothetical — it has already taken something

`ur15_mj.urdf:3`, a tracked file:

```
<!-- This document was autogenerated by xacro from
     /tmp/claude-1000/-home-rlrk-IsaacLab/b952db35-…/scratchpad/urdf_work/ur.urdf.xacro -->
```

A closed `find` over the **entire** session directory for `-name '*urdf*' -o -name '*xacro*'`
returns **nothing**. `urdf_work/` is gone.

⇒ the URDF itself is on disk and tracked, so the model is safe and nothing is blocked. What is
lost is the ability to **regenerate** it — and `ur15_cell_spec.py:99/:100` parse `EFFORT` and
`LIMS` out of that URDF, so it is a Tier A source whose upstream no longer exists. This is
measured evidence that contents of this directory do disappear, which is the claim the priority
argument needs and did not have.

## 5. The directory, measured

measured **2026-08-08 22:09:12 JST**: present, `drwx------`, dir mtime **Jul 29 20:30**; the
parent holds `scratchpad/` and `tasks/` only.

| file | size | mtime |
|---|---|---|
| `_arm_only_L.xml` | 4211 | Aug 4 15:26 |
| `_arm_only_R.xml` | 4556 | Aug 4 15:26 |
| `_steps_world.xml` | 28417 | Aug 4 15:26 |
| `_steps_cell_full.xml` | 61833 | Aug 4 15:26 |

⇒ exactly the four files `:131`/`:287`/`:328` write, from a run four days ago. **`sigma_trace.txt`
is absent** and so is `cell_settled.png`.

⚠ I cannot discriminate which driver wrote them — several siblings write the same names — nor
whether `sigma_trace.txt` was never reached, written by a driver that has none, or written and
removed. Stated as an observation with its ambiguity, not as a conclusion.

## 6. ⭐⭐ The instrument: a repo-root `grep -r` here silently omits TRACKED files

I hit a disagreement between two of my own searches — one found `armpd_video_20260727_0129.log`,
the other did not. Per m-p18-99 I asked the cheap question **first**: *did we search for the same
string?* I had used two (`claude-1000` and the uuid), so it was the live hypothesis. The 2×2 kills it:

| | root = the lane dir | root = repo root `.` |
|---|---|---|
| pattern `claude-1000` | **found** | **not found** |
| pattern `b952db35-…` | **found** | **not found** |

explicit-file control: **29 hits either way.** The file plainly contains both strings.
⇒ **the string is not the variable; the recursion root is.** p18's question was the right first
one and the answer here was on neither side of it.

**The mechanism, isolated.** `grep` in this environment is a shell function dispatching to
**ugrep** with `--ignore-files`. Root `/home/rlrk/IsaacLab/.gitignore:5` is `**/*.log*`. The
decisive A/B — same pattern, same root, one flag apart:

| instrument | files found | sees the tracked `.log`? |
|---|---|---|
| `grep -rl …  .` (default) | **24** | ⛔ **no** |
| `grep -rl --no-ignore-files … .` | **26** | ✅ yes (+ untracked `.claude/settings.local.json`) |
| **`git grep -l … cbb35bc78f`** | **25** | ✅ yes |

and the two the default drops: `.claude/settings.local.json` (untracked — correctly outside a
commit) and **`…/armpd_video_20260727_0129.log`, which `git ls-files` reports as TRACKED.**

⇒ the search tool applies `.gitignore` **patterns** without git's rule that a tracked file is
never ignored. Rooted one directory down, the root `.gitignore` sits above the walk and is never
read — which is why the same search finds the file from the lane dir and loses it from the repo
root.

⭐ **The operational consequence, which reaches well past this chunk: a repo-root `grep -r`
returning 0 is not absence.** It cannot see tracked `*.log*`, anything under `**/logs/*`
(`.gitignore:58`), or `/logs/` (`:120`). For a closed query, root the walk at the subtree, pass
`--no-ignore-files`, pass explicit files, or use `git grep <rev>` — which has the added property
that its answer is reproducible from a commit.

⚠ Scope of this finding: measured on this repo, this shell, today. I did not survey which past
absence claims were taken with the defective form.

## 7. Scope

**Did**: verify p18's citation; count the sites with three instruments including one over the
commit; close the query over all session ids; read every driver's video target before contradicting
the claim; trace all five uses of `S` and count the file's `mkdir` calls; run a closed `find` for
the xacro; measure the directory; isolate the grep behaviour with a 2×2, an explicit-file control
and a one-flag A/B; re-take every count from `cbb35bc78f`.

**Did not**: run any driver — the `write_text`-fails-on-missing-parent consequence in §3 is a code
reading, not an executed test; determine which driver last wrote the four XMLs; determine whose
session `b952db35` was (p18 states it; I did not verify ownership and it does not change anything
above); survey past absence claims for the §6 instrument; propose the fix — the shape of the
remedy is p4/p5's call, and I record only that any fix must cover **14 lines in 13 files** and
that **three of them are not named `S`**.

⛔ No implementation, no route run, nothing started. HOLD unchanged.
